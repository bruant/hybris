In an item type definition the 'partof' modifier describes the parent-child relationship in the case of the child becomes useless if the parent ceases to exist.
When the parent gets deleted then the child gets deleted as well. This is the cascade delete behavior.

Impex provides the possibility to insert parent and child with partof relation but it has to be done with separate lines. This is the case when we have to have a special reference 
between different lines: the document id.

Example (taken from Hybris WIKI page): customer and payment address where payment address has a back-reference to the user.

INSERT Customer; uid[unique=true]; ...; defaultPaymentAddress( &addrID ); ...
; andi; ...; addr1 ; ...
 
INSERT Address; &addrID ; owner( Customer.uid ); ...
; addr1 ; andi ; ...


We are not able to use the field(uid) reference as we don't know the address pk when we write the Impex file.
